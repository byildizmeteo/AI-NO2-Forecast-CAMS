# AI-Based NO₂ Forecasting using CAMS Data

This project is an AI/ML-driven approach to forecast nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) concentrations using atmospheric composition datasets from the [Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS)](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/).

The aim is to complement traditional numerical weather prediction models with machine learning-based emulators, inspired by the AIFS-COMPO system at ECMWF.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- 📥 Load and preprocess CAMS NO₂ data (NetCDF format)
- 🧪 Build a PyTorch-based time series prediction model
- 🌍 Visualize NO₂ forecast spatially using `cartopy` and `matplotlib`
- 🗂 Document the methodology in a Jupyter Notebook
- 🚀 Share results as open-source on GitHub

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies

- Python, NumPy, Pandas, xarray
- PyTorch, Scikit-learn
- netCDF4, Matplotlib, Cartopy
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔬 Status

Project in early development phase. Forecasting script and baseline model under construction.

## 📊 Example Visual (to be added)
